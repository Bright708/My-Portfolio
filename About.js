                    <h2>What I Do</h2>
                    <p>Over time, Iâ€™ve built a solid foundation in:
                        <ul>
                            <li><span>HTML,CSS and JavaScript </span>- I use these core technologies to bring interfaces to life.</li>
                            <li><span>Responsive Design </span>- I ensure websites work well across different screen sizes and devices</li>
                            <li><span>Clean Code & Structure</span>-I prioritize readability and maintainability in every project I build.</li>

                    <h2>ðŸŽ¨ My Approach</h2>
                    <p>
                    I believe good frontend development goes beyond just visuals. I aim to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Combine <span>functionality and aesthetics</span></li>
                        <li>Create intuitive user experience</li>
                        <li> Solve problems using <span>logical thinking and structured planning</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    Whether its building from scratch or iterating on feedback, I enjoy refining interfaces to better serve users.

                    <p>I also explore other key areas of software development to grow as a well-rounded engineer:

                            <li><span>Version Control</span>:I use Git to track changes and collaborate effectively</li>

                    <h2> I Value Collaboration</h2>
